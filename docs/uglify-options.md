# Options

This task primarily delegates to [UglifyJS2][], so please consider the [UglifyJS documentation][] as required reading for advanced configuration.

## mangle
Type: `Boolean` `Object`  
Default: `{}`

Turn on or off mangling with default options. If an `Object` is specified, it is passed directly to `ast.mangle_names()` *and* `ast.compute_char_frequency()` (mimicking command line behavior).

## compress
Type: `Boolean` `Object`  
Default: `{}`

Turn on or off source compression with default options. If an `Object` is specified, it is passed as options to `UglifyJS.Compressor()`.

## beautify
Type: `Boolean` `Object`  
Default: `false`

Turns on beautification of the generated source code. An `Object` will be merged and passed with the options sent to `UglifyJS.OutputStream()`

#### expression
Type: `Boolean`
Default: `false`

Parse a single expression, rather than a program (for parsing JSON)

## report
Choices: `'min'`, `'gzip'`  
Default: `'min'`

Either report only minification result or report minification and gzip results.
This is useful to see exactly how well clean-css is performing but using `'gzip'` will make the task take 5-10x longer to complete. [Example output](https://github.com/sindresorhus/maxmin#readme).

## sourceMap
Type: `Boolean`  
Default: `false`

If `true`, a source map file will be generated in the same directory as the `dest` file. By default it will have the same basename as the `dest` file, but with a `.map` extension.

## sourceMapName
Type: `String`  `Function`  
Default: `undefined`

To customize the name or location of the generated source map, pass a string to indicate where to write the source map to. If a function is provided, the uglify destination is passed as the argument and the return value will be used as the file name.

## sourceMapIn
Type: `String`  `Function`  
Default: `undefined`

The location of an input source map from an earlier compilation, e.g. from CoffeeScript. If a function is provided, the
uglify source is passed as the argument and the return value will be used as the sourceMap name. This only makes sense
when there's one source file.

## sourceMapIncludeSources
Type: `Boolean`
Default: `false`

Pass this flag if you want to include the content of source files in the source map as sourcesContent property.

#### enclose
Type: `Object`  
Default: `undefined`

Wrap all of the code in a closure with a configurable arguments/parameters list.
Each key-value pair in the `enclose` object is effectively an argument-parameter pair.

## wrap
Type: `String`  
Default: `undefined`

Wrap all of the code in a closure, an easy way to make sure nothing is leaking.
For variables that need to be public `exports` and `global` variables are made available.
The value of wrap is the global variable exports will be available as.

## exportAll
Type: `Boolean`  
Default: `false`

When using `wrap` this will make all global functions and variables available via the export variable.

## preserveComments
Type: `Boolean` `String` `Function`  
Default: `undefined`  
Options: `false` `'all'` `'some'`

Turn on preservation of comments.

- `false` will strip all comments
- `'all'` will preserve all comments in code blocks that have not been squashed or dropped
- `'some'` will preserve all comments that start with a bang (`!`) or include a closure compiler style directive (`@preserve` `@license` `@cc_on`)
- `Function` specify your own comment preservation function. You will be passed the current node and the current comment and are expected to return either `true` or `false`

## banner
Type: `String`  
Default: empty string

This string will be prepended to the minified output.  Template strings (e.g. `<%= config.value %>` will be expanded automatically.

## footer
Type: `String`  
Default: empty string

This string will be appended to the minified output.  Template strings (e.g. `<%= config.value %>` will be expanded automatically.
